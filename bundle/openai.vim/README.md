## Installation

This plugin follows the standard runtime path structure. Below are some helper lines
for popular package managers:

* [Vim 8 packages](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/repeat.txt.html#packages)
  * `git clone https://github.com/jessfraz/openai.vim.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/openai.vim`
* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

  * `Plugin 'jessfraz/openai.vim'`

You must have `curl` and `jq` installed locally, as well as `OPENAI_API_KEY` set
in your environment.

## Usage

With your cursor on a line of text, or a selection of text in visual mode, 
`:OpenAIComplete` will send the line of text or selection to the OpenAI API and
append the result in the lines following.

Or you can use whatever your `<Leader>` key is + `o` to complete the selection
or line.

As seen in the gif below this is better for written words than code.
